OGIex are scripts from building a docker image to running a demo of paper implementations by three or fewer commands and works.

## How to use
1. Select a script dir in the `environments` dir.
2. Check a `README.md` written commands to run scripts in the folder.

## Script dir list
The list of available scripts is below. `Dirname`, `Code`, and `Paper` columns denote script directory links, implementation links, and article links, respectively.
